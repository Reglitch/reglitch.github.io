With <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3pa6ra/spec_diversity_legionunofficial_leak/\">early leaks</a> speculating that Mistweavers would be doing lots of complaining, this was something I personally had expected for a while, but not to the extent where Mistweavers would be delegated to the range stack. Extremely disappointing, but nothing new when it comes to choices with the Mistweaver.</p>\n<p>With the latest build however, we have two new talents that bring us back into melee with a gameplay that mimics the old times of Throne of Thunder. Let&#39;s take a look.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"the-holy-trinity\">The Holy Trinity</h3>\n<div class=\"tooltip-spread\">\n  <a class=\"wow-spell\" data-id=\"210802\"></a>\n  <a class=\"wow-spell\" data-id=\"116645\"></a>\n  <a class=\"wow-spell\" data-id=\"210804\"></a>\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<p>In Warlords, Fistweaving has been gated behind a stance, and the spec was given a 1.5 second GCD along with more cast times. This has been successful in wiping out any &#39;cherry picking&#39; that was present in the spec, but entirely destroyed the original feel of slamming your enemies with a punch or two between throwing out instant heals. On top of this, the stance was implemented quite poorly, with an on GCD switch that took too long to switch in to. This definitely made you commit into Crane stance a lot more, but oftentimes it fell by the wayside for players who weren&#39;t confident or didn&#39;t feel like the effort was worth it.</p>\n<p>This is the return of the original playstyle, but more in thanks to Rising Thunder than Spirit of the Crane. With these talents paying attention to enemies and your full kit is rewarded, maybe not as much as it could be, but definitely more than what have been seeing with Legion so far. Eminence might be gone, but thanks to the synergy between Gust of Mist, Renewing Mist, Thunder Focus Tea, and Rising Thunder, finding an enemy and punching them in the face has never been a better idea.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"damage-for-healers\">Damage for Healers</h3>\n<p>Damage is an important thing in World of Warcraft, it is arguably the primary driver for the majority of changes in game state. Plans are currently to have healers level through content in their healing specialization due to Artifacts. Now more than ever, Healers should be concerned about their ability to deal damage while also having fun.</p>\n<p>I might have lost some people there, there is definitely a case to be made for healers who rolled healers to heal - period. I also think there&#39;s some validity in the minds of damage dealers who worry their role will be outmoded. Luckily there are a couple of solutions for these worries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The option to opt-out of traditional methods of dealing damage, and further emphasize the support role to provide similar contributions.</li>\n<li>The current damage buff on PTR for certain healing classes in open world situations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be completely clear, <strong>I am not advocating for the buffing of healer damage to be close with dps.</strong> Instead I am advocating that healer damage should be useful in a few <em>very specific</em> contexts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a skilled (team of) healer(s) have significantly outplayed or outgeared content, allowing them to provide contributions past the binary measure of success of keeping players alive.</li>\n<li>When a healer is alone and has to kill an enemy to meet basic requirements in the game such as quests or daily quests.</li>\n<li>When damage is valued so much that even providing a small amount more is more valuable than maintaining full healing output. (Burst)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately Rising Thunder brings this to the table, it provides an easy way of contributing damage and thus if you improve your play with Rising Thunder you will see success past simply keeping people alive - you will also see more damage. Point #2 could be improved upon, Rising Thunder does not significantly effect your playstyle while alone, but a damage effect could be quite easily added to TFT&#39;s buff pool. I would suggest something along these lines:</p>\n<div>\n  <a class=\"wow-spell wide\" data-id=\"116680\"></a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Slap on a Blackout Kick cleave and a huge buff to TP damage in memoriam. Not only would it significantly improve Mistweaver damage while solo, it would also provide a higher skill cap for skilled players who cannot further improve their healing in the circumstances.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"so-what-does-rising-thunder-do\">So What does Rising Thunder Do</h3>\n<p>Simply put; Rising Thunder puts your Thunder Focus Tea on a much shorter cooldown and allows it to scale with haste. This has interesting effects particularly for Renewing Mist. For example, without Rising Thunder haste will increase your Renewing Mist healing by the amount of haste you have, say 30% haste will mean exactly 30% more raw Renewing Mist healing.</p>\n<p class=\"stretch\"><a href=\"/images/abilityfreq.png\"><img src=\"/images/abilityfreq.png\" alt=\"Holy Shit\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the amount of <em>everything</em> scales up with haste pretty much directly. These numbers are taken from the output of a simulation, with a rotation of,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TFT off CD -&gt; ReM with TFT Stacks -&gt; RSK off CD -&gt; ReM without TFT stacks -&gt; TP</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the event that you spend your TFT on Renewing Mist exclusively, you get an appropriate amount of more ReM casts considering your haste level. Haste also benefits these additional Renewing Mist instances, while this doesn&#39;t create an effect such as Armor Penetration where getting more made the stat better, it does mean that the stat is <em>significantly</em> better than anything else for doing this one specific thing. So much so I believe that it has the potential to drive stat priorities significantly towards haste and mastery.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h3>\n<p>Rising Thunder and Spirit of the Crane are two very needed talents in the healer meta and the game needs to see more of them. Statements such as,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Mistweavers, it’s OK to have open global cooldowns between heals—Soothing Mist fills these gaps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19964703/legion-class-preview-series-monk-11-11-2015\">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19964703/legion-class-preview-series-monk-11-11-2015</a></p>\n<p>Are very uninspiring, especially for a specialization such as the Mistweaver which has a very strong history in being incredibly active. It&#39;s not okay to have open global cooldowns in an environment where individuals are extremely competitive. Players should never be left in a situation where improving their performance meaningfully is impossible.</p>\n<p>As I said at the beginning of this post, these additions are a start, Mistweavers in particular have a lot of snap decision potential to regain after losing both their interrupt and Touch of Death. These abilities contribute a huge amount to the skill cap of the spec, interrupting for example has historically been one of the things that made a great healer great.</p>\n<p>This has been my first effort post in \\x7e2.5 years or so, I think it&#39;s not entirely crap. Poking around and figuring out how these abilities will shape the experience for Mistweavers going forward has been fun, now we just need to stop Blizzard deleting them in the next build.</p>\n<p>Remember to click the footer!
