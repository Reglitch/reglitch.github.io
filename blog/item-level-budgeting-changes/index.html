If you have played a previous expansion, there is always a small period of time when all players have very small amounts of stats and feel significantly weaker than they were even at the last level cap.</p><p>You can look through the post <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742704730?page=1#1">here</a>, but for the purposes of this post all you need to really see is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Conversion rates of Rating-&gt;% for secondary stats will not go up as much as they otherwise would, by a huge margin. The conversion rates will end up at 110 at less than half of what they otherwise would have, resulting in Legion dungeon blue gear providing over double the total secondary stat %s, as the it did in prior expansions.</p><p>Starting at ilvl 800, the exponential curve for secondary stats will be significantly reduced, nearly to being linear (this is per-item, not related to the character&#39;s average item level). Primary stats and Stamina will continue to scale exponentially with ilvl at the same rate as before. This will mean that players retain all of the same customization they had, but with secondary stat %s not scaling higher than they had before, by the end of the expansion.</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id=how-does-this-effect-stat-scaling>How Does This Effect Stat Scaling</h3><p>This change alone does not, however the scalars for all secondaries has been changed with this build. The usual diminishment on stats per point as you level will not be as radical also. What this means is that at level 110, one point of each stat will give you significantly <em>more</em> than it did before.</p><pre><code class=hljs><span class=hljs-prompt>Haste: 445 -&gt;</span> <span class=hljs-number>227</span>

Interestingly, primary stat scaling remains as it has always been, but with secondary statistics giving double the amount they used to a lot of classes may start preferring them over their primary statistic. This is unlikely to last though.</p><hr><h3 id=what-does-this-mean-for-items->What Does This Mean for Items?</h3><p>For items this means that the increase of secondary statistics will be offset by an internal value, resulting in a much more linear increase. This ultimately results in less secondary stats, but they are more powerful to offset for that.</p><p>To add to that, the current method of improving artifacts relies on socketing relics that improve your item level. If you&#39;re interested in what those increases look like you can make use of the <a href=/item-calculator>Item Calculator</a> for Legion. It will recursively calculate the changes of stats from one item level to another between the range that is effected by these changes. It will also give you information of how much of a % change the result is, so you can better gauge the strength of each increase.</p><hr><h3 id=what-does-this-mean-for-me->What Does This Mean for Me?</h3><p>Probably nothing, outside of seriously strong secondaries there is nothing of interest in these changes. Your predicted strongest stat is likely the same (ceteris paribus), and with the removal of spirit these changes really don&#39;t have much of an impact on healer gameplay. There may be minor interesting ways with how these changes interact with procs on trinkets and so on, but those remain to be seen!</p></article><div class=post-content><div id=disqus_thread></div></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="p2 wrap"><div class="measure mt1 center"><small><a href="/memes/">memes</a></small></div></div></footer></div><script src=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/tooltips.js></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
