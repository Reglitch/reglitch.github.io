It creates a gearing strategy that removes Essence Font from your spell selection pool in a lot of situations. You do not necessarily lose healing from this omission though, as Gust of Mists is over-budgeted for a lot of spells.</p><h2 id=budget-comparison>Budget Comparison</h2><p>Take a look at rating conversion rates:</p><pre><code class=hljs><span class=hljs-attribute>Haste</span>: <span class=hljs-string>275</span>
<span class=hljs-attribute>Crit</span>: <span class=hljs-string>300</span>
<span class=hljs-attribute>Mastery</span>: <span class=hljs-string>300</span>
<span class=hljs-attribute>Versatility</span>: <span class=hljs-string>350</span></code></pre><p>For your typical spells, this results in the following breakdown:</p><hr><table><thead><tr><th>Stat [+300]</th><th>Renewing Mist</th><th>Effuse</th><th>Enveloping Mist</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mastery</td><td>10% spellpower</td><td>10% spellpower</td><td>13% spellpower</td></tr><tr><td>Crit</td><td>7.15% spellpower</td><td>2.2% spellpower</td><td>11.88% spellpower</td></tr><tr><td>Haste</td><td>7.8% spellpower</td><td>0% spellpower</td><td>12.96% spellpower</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><p>We&#39;ll only look at the 3 stats that are competitive output-wise here, versatility has it&#39;s own benefits but we won&#39;t derail this post.</p><p>You can quite clearly see that in all situations mastery has the upper hand - in fact, mastery would have the upper hand even if the amount of stats provided by haste or critical strike rating were slightly above it. Here&#39;s why;</p><ul><li>Gust of Mist is a direct heal, mastery allows you to &#39;withdraw&#39; prolonged healing from HoTs and get it when you need it.</li><li>Gust of Mists provides both efficiency and superior output, haste does not out-perform it at any point - yet with each point of haste you incur a cost penalty.</li></ul><p>In effect, Gust of Mists is crit but better - crit has always been an amazing statistic for Mistweavers, and it still will be because it synergizes well with Gust of Mists and doesn&#39;t increase mana expenditure.</p><h2 id=so-what-s-the-problem->So What&#39;s the Problem?</h2><p>Earlier I mentioned that I don&#39;t see an optional phasing out of Essence Font as a problem. It&#39;s not; but there are situations where spells will be phased out in every possible situation, simply because Mastery and Effuse will overtake them.</p><p>In particular, the two largest culprits are:</p><div class="tooltip-spread two-items"><a class=wow-spell data-id=197945></a> <a class=wow-spell data-id=205406></a></div><p>In one case, the spell is a &quot;utility&quot; that heals players as you teleport them at the cost of your Transcendence ability. In the other, it is the hallmark artifact ability that is supposed to supplement the class, currently the assumption is being made that the current stack count max on alpha is a bug.</p><p>Both of these spells get easily outmatched by Gust of Mists on Effuse. Yet they both fit in the criteria for Gust of Mists&#39; beneficiaries, creating a situation where these spells simply won&#39;t be used. For example, why risk a volatile change in position for a smaller heal?</p><p>Mistwalk in particular can be used ~20% more often than Transcendence, but offers little in the way of the functionality that Transcendence has. Transcendence is an ability that is used to go places where players aren&#39;t at already, Mistwalk lacks that major use case and a tiny 350% heal does not bring it to standard - particularly when the opportunity cost of not taking either Chi Burst or Zen Pulse exists.</p><p>It is clear that Chi Torpedo served as a mobility/heal combination far better than Mistwalk ever will; as it let you heal the raid and move with them when necessary. For Mistwalk to serve the same purpose; you would have to wait in the same area players moved from to get the mobility benefit - arguably killing yourself in the process. Ultimately the ability feels like something that Holy Paladins would benefit more from.</p><p>Sheilun&#39;s Gift is a little more complex, if the current alpha behavior of stacking to 12 continues - then it will exist as a seldom used ability. It will still be used however, so it would exist in the same area as Essence Font in terms of being an ability that becomes less frequently selected, but when it is that selection is particularly in favor of the spell. If it does not stack beyond an easily attainable mastery value, the spell will simply be phased out completely.</p><p>So to conclude, Gust isn&#39;t a broken mastery in any sense of the term - it&#39;s simply unique. There are some potential problem areas where it can simply envelop other spells however, and it would be nice to see these cleaned up a little bit. Especially in the case of Mistwalk, there is a problem of finding an actual use case for a heal and mobility combo that heals a single target and forces you to lag behind them. This simply doesn&#39;t happen in PvE, meaning the only realistic use for the ability is battlefield traversal; something we have next to no need of.</p></article><div class=post-content><div id=disqus_thread></div></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="p2 wrap"><div class="measure mt1 center"><small><a href="/memes/">memes</a></small></div></div></footer></div><script src=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/tooltips.js></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
